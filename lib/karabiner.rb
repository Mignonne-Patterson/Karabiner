# Karabiner Ruby Library
# This library is a part of [Karabiner](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) which helps users to remap and customize their keyboard inputs on macOS.

## Features
# The following features are available in this library:
# - Remapping individual keys or entire key layers
# - Creating custom sequences for triggering actions
# - Scripting feature that allows automating complex tasks based upon rules

# This library provides a simple and flexible way to customize keyboard behavior.

module Karabiner
  # Remaps key1 to key2
  # @param key1 [String] the key to be remapped
  # @param key2 [String] the key to map to
  def self.remap(key1, key2)
    # Implementation for remapping key1 to key2
  end

  # Creates a custom key sequence
  # @param keys [Array<String>] an array of keys to be executed in sequence
  def self.key_sequence(keys)
    # Implementation for creating a key sequence
  end

  # Executes a script based on the given rules
  # @param rules [Array<Hash>] an array of rules describing input-output transformations
  def self.script(rules)
    # Implementation for executing a script based on rules
  end

  # Creates a complex remapping based on conditions
  # @param conditions [Array<Hash>] an array of conditions to check before applying remaps
  # @param remaps [Array<Hash>] an array of remaps to apply if conditions are met
  def self.conditional_remap(conditions, remaps)
    # Implementation for conditional remapping
  end

  # Logs the current key mapping state
  # Useful for debugging and verifying remaps
  def self.log_mappings
    # Implementation for logging current mappings
  end
end

# Example usage:
# Remap 'a' to 'b'
Karabiner.remap('a', 'b')

# Create a key sequence: Shift + Command + Space, then Left Arrow
Karabiner.key_sequence(['shift', 'command', 'space', 'left'])

# Define a script with rules
k_script = [
  {
    "type" => 0,
    "from" => { "key_code" => "a" },
    "to" => { "key_code" => "b" }
  }
]
Karabiner.script(k_script)

# Define a complex remapping with conditions
conditions = [
  {
    "type" => "device_if",
    "identifiers" => [
      {
        "vendor_id" => 1452,
        "product_id" => 610
      }
    ]
  }
]
remaps = [
  {
    "from" => { "key_code" => "caps_lock" },
    "to" => { "key_code" => "escape" }
  }
]
Karabiner.conditional_remap(conditions, remaps)

# Log the current key mappings
Karabiner.log_mappings
